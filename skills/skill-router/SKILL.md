# Skill Router

## Goal

Route the task to the smallest workflow that controls the risk. Do not run every skill.

This skill is the canonical runtime routing source. `AGENTS.md` only contains the minimal kernel-level routing gate, and documentation tables or workflow examples must mirror this skill instead of defining competing routes.

## Use when

- The task is non-trivial and the correct workflow is unclear.
- The task has multiple possible modes: design, implementation, review, investigation, risk, or handoff.
- The user asks broadly and the agent must decide how to proceed without over-processing.

## Do not use when

- The task is a trivial local edit.
- The user explicitly names a relevant skill and no routing decision is needed.

## Inputs

- User request.
- Available repository context.
- Known risk: behavior, data, API, security, deployment, performance, or external side effects.

## Process

1. Classify the task.

| Class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `trivial` | Small local edit with obvious scope. |
| `implementation` | Code change with observable behavior. |
| `design` | Plan, architecture, API, schema, workflow, or ambiguous requirement. |
| `investigation` | Bug, regression, unknown root cause, performance, reliability, or research-like question. |
| `review` | Diff, PR, generated code, design, readiness, or claim evaluation. |
| `handoff` | State transfer or next task creation. |
| `risk-gated` | Destructive, irreversible, secret-sensitive, production-facing, or externally visible work. |

2. Estimate risk.

| Risk | Signals |
|---|---|
| Low | Local change, known files, no behavior/API/data impact. |
| Medium | User-visible behavior, multiple files, tests needed, ambiguous edge cases. |
| High | Public API/schema, auth/security, persistence, migration, performance claim, broad refactor. |
| Critical | Production deploy, destructive command, credentials, payments, email sending, data deletion. |

3. Select the workflow.

| Situation | Primary | Secondary |
|---|---|---|
| Unfamiliar repo | `repository-orientation` | `scope-control` if target boundary is unclear; `planning-with-files` only if the task spans sessions/agents or durable state is needed |
| Ambiguous design / “grill me” | `grill-design` | `grill-with-docs` if docs/domain/ADR terms matter; then `spec-driven-development` only after design boundary and acceptance criteria are stable |
| Existing docs/domain/ADR constraints | `grill-with-docs` | `adr-review` |
| Application boundary decision needed before implementation, including dependency direction, state ownership, external I/O boundary, DTO/error trust boundary, async lifetime, feature public API, usecase/repository/port/adapter/mapper necessity, ID boundary, or architecture guard rollout | `application-boundary-architecture` | Return to `spec-driven-development` or `controlled-implementation` after the boundary decision; use `adr-review` if hard-to-reverse or record-worthy |
| New behavior | `spec-driven-development` | `controlled-implementation` -> `test-first-verification` |
| Implementation after plan exists | `controlled-implementation` | `scope-control` |
| Long-running/multi-agent work | `planning-with-files` | `handoff-generation` |
| Scope/refactor risk | `scope-control` | `controlled-implementation` if proceeding to code; review phase uses `review-router` -> `review-ai-quality` |
| Bug/unknown cause | `doubt-driven-development` | `test-first-verification` for reproduction -> `controlled-implementation` -> `test-first-verification` for regression proof |
| Hard-to-reverse architecture decision or ADR need | `adr-review` | `grill-with-docs`; `application-boundary-architecture` if boundary mechanics are unresolved |
| PR/diff/generated code review | `review-router` | `review-final-merge-gate` |
| MR/PR README, PR explanation, or durable change-context documentation | `mr-readme-generation` | `adr-review` |
| Claim validation | `evidence-ledger` | `doubt-driven-development` |
| End of work | `handoff-generation` | — |

4. Apply project overlay skill selection.
   - If a project overlay contains framework, domain, UI/UX, architecture, CI, data, security, or other repository-specific skills, consider them after generic workflow selection.
   - Select overlay skills only when the overlay signal applies to the selected work type.
   - Do not add project-specific skills to the generic routing table.

5. State what is intentionally skipped.

6. Apply overlays before action.
   - Risk overlay: if any task involves destructive, external, production, auth, secret, dependency, migration, billing, email, or infra impact, run `risk-gate` before the selected workflow proceeds to action.
   - Evidence overlay: use `evidence-ledger` whenever the response makes or evaluates a claim about correctness, fixed behavior, no regression, readiness, performance, security, reliability, UX, cost, or maintainability.

7. Continue into the selected primary workflow unless the task requires user approval.

## Output

```text
Selected workflow:
- Primary:
- Secondary:
- Project overlay skills:
- Skipped:

Reason:
- Task class:
- Risk level:
- Decisive signal:

Next action:
- ...
```

## Exit criteria

- One primary workflow is selected.
- Any secondary workflow has a clear reason.
- Trivial work is not over-processed.
- Critical risk is routed to `risk-gate` before action.

## Failure modes

| Failure | Correction |
|---|---|
| Running all skills | Use smallest sufficient workflow. |
| Skipping process for high-risk work | Reclassify by impact, not diff size. |
| Asking broad questions before routing | Route first; ask only blocking questions. |
